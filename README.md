# Random_codes

all of these codes are just for the sole purpose of satisfing my math curiosity, but feel free to use them if you don't value your time.

001  is just the infamous collatz conjecture. I will try to add graph for it in the future. Maybe?

002 checks whether the given input is a prime or not. Just input a large value of integer in the expense of your precious time.

003 show prime numbers depending of how much the user wants to see.

004 shows primes with last digits.

005 will show all the factors of an input integer

006 a lousy code for decimal-binary converter

007 a simple code for x-mas tree that is meticulously retrieved somewhere from the internet.

008 shows the value of Pi using Leibniz formula for Pi. Accurate up to 3 decimal places after hundreds of thousands of iteration. :).

009 calculates how much time will you spend if you watch video improperly. Like how much time can you procrastinate after...
